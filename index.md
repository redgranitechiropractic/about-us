# What Is Chiropractic Care?
Chiropractic care is the practice of using spinal alignment to alleviate a
wide variety of physical ailments, including muscle strain, neck pain,
chronic back pain, and more. This is accomplished by adjusting the
position of the spinal column to its proper shape, providing a non-
invasive solution for pain relief. A chiropractor doesn't just treat back pain;
because chiropractors help to remove pressure from the nervous
system, they can also influence many other conditions. It is common
to hear chiropractic patients say that they came in for back pain and
their headaches got better.

# The Education of a Chiropractor
Many people are unaware of how much schooling is required to become a chiropractor.
Chiropractors are held to very high educational standards that are comparable to those
of a medical doctor. After earning a Bachelor's degree with a strong emphasis of basic sciences in college,
chiropractors attend a four year chiropractic college. Chiropractors are primary care
physicians, which means you don't need a referral to receive chiropractic care.
